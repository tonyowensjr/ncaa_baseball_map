# ncaa_baseball_map

## This project contains the source code for acquiring the data for my QGIS map containing all NCAA baseball games of 2023.
## The map is availble at the following link: [ncaa map](https://qgiscloud.com/tonyowens/ncaa_baseball_2023/)
## To acquire the data for the map I used the [BaseballR](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package and to find the coordinates for each location for each game I used the [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package.

## Next Steps:
## When I revisit this project, I plan to add additional years, and potentially give the user the ability to select between years.
